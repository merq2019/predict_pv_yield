Express target as min-max scaled $PV(location, time)/GHI(location, time)$. Network trained is the same as `001` in structure and this was trained across all systems.                                                                                                                                                                 | Trained for 4,000 (converged) batches and achieved test MAE of ~ 0.010 on PV/GHI. Some plots show that some PV systems have anomalously high values in their time series (at least one system where anomalous value is 1000s of time greater than other values), ones that couldn't be physical. We make a more robust min-max scaling to deal with this. , | The robust min-max scaling developed here is used from this point forward. It is therefore invalid to compare metric scores to experiments before this. |
